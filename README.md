## Draw Banner
Create a function called `DrawBanner` that takes in some text (`std::string`) and displays a banner effect around it. The function draws `*` around the text to draw the banner. For example, given the text `"Hello world!"`, the function will display the following banner on the screen.

```
****************
* Hello world! *
****************
```

Take note there is a space between the first asterisk and first letter of the text. Similarly, there is a space between the last letter of the text and the last asterisk.

## Header files
We encourage you to use best practices by separating your functions into header and implementation files.
